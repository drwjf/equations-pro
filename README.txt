An educational app to teach students how to balance chemical equations. Built in 2011 for iPhone and Android.

I've changed the minimum versions so they can run on modern iOS/Android devices, and I converted the Eclipse project to Android Studio. Please let me know if you have any difficulties running the code. It's pretty old, but I can probably revise it if needed.
